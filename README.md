# What is this?

Hi! After working on this project privately for a couple of months, I decided to make it public.

This isn't designed for the general public, but is rather a website created to help my high school English teacher. I noticed that the way she tracked book check outs was with index cards. I thought that was inefficient and tedious. Hence, I decided to work on a project to help her out!

The goal for this project is for students to browse the classroom library, read reviews posted by other students, and check out books. The teacher can add/remove books from the library, view who has taken out what book, when they plan to return it, etc. There is also a neat little mailing system implemented. :)

As of now, the project isn't 100% complete, but I am getting to a usable state. If the project works well with my teacher, I plan on showcasing it to other English teachers to gather feedback. From there, we'll see what happens. :)

I hope that this project can help my English teacher spend less time writing on index cards, and can instead have a digital way to organize her classroom library.

Thanks for reading! I apologize for the code base, it is starting to grow in size and I'm doing my best to maintain it. If at any point you feel like you can contribute, I'd be more than happy to take a look at your suggestions/feeback.

Thanks!
